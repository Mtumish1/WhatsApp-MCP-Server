# 📱 WhatsApp MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates WhatsApp into AI agent workflows — enabling agents to read, respond, and act on WhatsApp conversations securely and contextually.

This server acts as a bridge between WhatsApp and a Large Language Model (LLM) agent via the Model Context Protocol, allowing WhatsApp chats to become part of agentic automation systems, whether for personal assistants, business bots, or multi-channel communication tools.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

AI agents are only as useful as the tools they can access. WhatsApp is one of the most widely used communication platforms in the world — and now, with this MCP server, it can become a powerful part of your agentic stack.

This project allows LLMs (like Claude, GPT-4, or open-source models) to:
- Retrieve recent WhatsApp messages in a structured context
- Understand and summarize chats
- Generate draft replies
- Act based on WhatsApp communication triggers

## 🧠 What Is Model Context Protocol?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a specification for safely connecting LLMs to tools and external data sources. Instead of giving a model full API access, MCP provides **structured, explainable context** about a system and accepts **natural language actions** to act on it — with a human-readable audit trail.
